# Structural Direction (vNext)
## PFTE / Rank-3 Closure Framework

**Status note**  
This document records the current *structural organization* of the PFTE / Rank-3 framework.
It is directional rather than final. Foundational derivations remain stable; interpretation,
classification, and regime semantics are under active development.
This outline exists to keep thinking, documentation, and experiments aligned.

---

## 1. Purpose of this document

PFTE and Rank-3 have reached a stage where foundations are stable, but interpretation
and classification have evolved faster than published documents.
This outline serves three functions:

1. Declare which components are *frozen*
2. Declare which components are *semantically updated*
3. Declare which components are *actively exploratory*

This is not a rewrite and does not supersede existing documents.

---

## 2. Frozen foundations (unchanged)

The following elements are considered structurally stable and are not under revision:

### 2.1 Pre-ontological necessity
Derived from existence → distinction → bipolarity → change → comparison → time →
rates → infinite refinement → bounded coherence window.

No ontology, dynamics, or physics assumptions are introduced at this level.

### 2.2 Rank-3 closure kernel
Any meaningful emergence framework must realize three irreducible closure roles:

- **un** — exclusion / inaccessibility
- **able** — capacity for change
- **coh** — separation of persistence from breakdown

These roles are logically prior to entities, laws, or observables.

### 2.3 MFSEC (Method for Fixed Structural Exclusion by Constraints)
PFTE is developed under MFSEC:
absence is treated as information, not as a prompt to add structure.
Assumptions are frozen, outcomes are probed, and only structural necessity motivates relaxation.

---

## 3. Updated semantics (vNext)

### 3.1 Roles defined via failure modes

The closure roles are now interpreted primarily through *failure*, not success:

- **coh failure**  
  Predictability through time breaks down under fixed constraints.
  Re-determination becomes necessary.

- **able failure**  
  Opposing constraints overpower one another, forcing change.

- **un failure**  
  Distinctions collapse through indistinguishability or over-symmetry.

“Success” is treated as asymptotic persistence, not as a primitive state.

---

### 3.2 Coherence as predictability-through-time

Coherence is no longer treated as static stability.
A configuration is coherent if future behavior remains inferable from present constraints
over extended time windows.

This reframing directly informs simulation diagnostics and regime classification.

---

## 4. PFTE substrate commitments (current working set)

PFTE continues to operate under the following fixed commitments:

- Single continuous complex field ψ(x,t)
- Local evolution rules (CGLE-like)
- Fixed background domain
- No particle primitives
- Identity forced only by invariants (topology)
- Explicit diagnostics for coherence, topology, and kinematics

Objects are not introduced; they are *forced*.

---

## 5. Defects as forced identity carriers (unchanged, clarified)

Persistent identity requires a deformation-invariant tag.
In a continuous local field, such tags are topological.

Defects therefore function as *forced identity carriers*:
long-time degrees of freedom reduce to defect worldlines, charges,
and derived relational observables.

This is a reduction, not an assumption.

---

## 6. Structural regime callification (new)

PFTE outcomes are now classified by *structural regime* rather than surface behavior.

Canonical regimes include:

- **Null / relaxational**  
  Distinctions annihilate; collapse toward indistinguishable limits.

- **Identity-stable (kinematic)**  
  Defect count is preserved; coherent motion persists.

- **Composite-stable**  
  Persistence requires confinement or multi-defect structure.

- **Over-driven / breakdown**  
  Coherence fails due to excessive differentiation or numerical artifacts.

These regimes are defined by closure realization, not resemblance to known physics.
Analogies (fermionic, gauge-like, scalar-like) may be drawn only *after* classification.

---

## 7. Phase-diagram semantics (updated)

Parameter space is treated as an **accessibility landscape**, not a tuning surface.

Each region encodes:
- what transitions are accessible (**able**),
- what outcomes persist (**coh**),
- what never appears under fixed assumptions (**un**).

Boundaries are predictions, not artifacts.

---

## 8. Measurement discipline (unchanged, emphasized)

Only measurements taken within coherent windows are considered meaningful.
Estimators must reflect continuous trajectories and physical time,
not grid artifacts or event counts.

Failure of robustness is treated as structural information.

---

## 9. Current exploratory directions (non-final)

Active areas of investigation include:
- semantic mapping of regime classes,
- oscillatory and merger modes as interaction carriers,
- multi-defect closure behavior,
- predictive use of regime boundaries.

These directions are provisional and intentionally flexible.

---

## 10. Scope boundary

This framework does not attempt to answer questions beyond the coherence window.
Where distinction collapses, questions themselves lose meaning.

Silence beyond that boundary is not ignorance.
It is correctness.
